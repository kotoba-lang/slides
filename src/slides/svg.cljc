  "A slide, drawn.

  The editor could edit a text box and sent every other shape to the JSON
  pane, on the grounds that position and fill are a canvas's job. They are —
  and a canvas is a picture, which is what this makes. Numbers for `x`, `y`,
  `w` and `h` are worth typing once you can see what they move.

  ## SVG, and here rather than in an application

  A string, so the same slide can be tested without a browser, rendered
  server-side, and put in a page by anything that can put a string in a
  page. `slides.pptx` already knows how to draw these shapes into a
  presentation; this is the same knowledge pointed at a screen, and an
  application drawing its own would be the second one.

  ## Inches, because that is what a slide is in

  `slides.model` measures in inches — `:slides/x 0.8` is eight tenths of an
  inch from the left — and a deck is 10 × 5.625 unless it says otherwise.
  The SVG uses those numbers directly as its viewBox, so a shape's numbers
  and its position are the same thing and nothing has to be converted to
  find out where something is."

  for the same picture. Nothing looks different — SVG reads both — but any
  two things that compare the drawings disagree, and a cache keyed on them
  never hits. `sheets` met this in a workbook's bytes and fixed it there;
  this is the same fix on the surface next door.

  Four decimals, which is a ten-thousandth of an inch: far below anything a
  screen can show, and enough to keep `0.1 + 0.2` from printing its tail."

  cover a ten-inch slide in grey blocks. That is what this did: the outlines
  were unreadable on screen while every assertion about them passed, because
  the element is right and only its width is wrong. Nothing in a string test
